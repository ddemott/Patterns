/**
 * Chain of Responsibility
 * 
 * Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve lose coupling in software
 * design where a request from client is passed to a chain of objects to process
 * them. Then the object in the chain will decide themselves who will be
 * processing the request and whether the request is required to be sent to the
 * next object in the chain or not.
