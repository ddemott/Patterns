/**
 * Template Method
 * 
 * Template Method is a behavioral design pattern and it’s used to create a
 * method stub and deferring some of the steps of implementation to the
 * subclasses. Template method defines the steps to execute an algorithm and it
 * can provide default implementation that might be common for all or some of
 * the subclasses.
